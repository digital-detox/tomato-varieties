# Tomato varieties

### The breif

We need to quickly knock-up a responsive carousel for a demo this afternoon. We can return to our code after the demo for touch gestures.

### Basic requirements:

1. The UX team love the Bupa Health Information carousel: http://www.bupa.co.uk/health-information.
2. Can we build something similar for tomatos.
3. Each slide should have an image, description and customer rating - similar to the BMI calculator slide on the page.
4. The carousel needs to be infitite scoll.
5. No pagination is required.
6. ***Important:*** For mobile devices the tomato slides should stack vertically only showing the top four tomato slides - similar to the Tools and calculators content on the same page.

### Star rating requirements:

1. The star ratings should randomly be populated on page load for the demo.
2. When a user hovers over the stars the average rating should be hidden.
3. When a user clicks one of the stars it should save their rating for the demo - only for the session.
